#LJ Code201 - Day 9

I thought the conversation about general style in writing code was interesting. The main takeaways were that order matters, global variables should be at the top of the page, local variables should be at the top of the function.

I understand the different type of CSS positioning (static, relative, absolute, fixed), but I need more practice knowing when and how to best use them.
