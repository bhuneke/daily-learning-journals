#LJ Code201 - Day 7

I am still working through grasping the DOM manipulation steps. I need more practice.

It was interesting to learn about adding functions to a constructor object through prototypes. I understand why this step is necessary, to keep from repeating the same code over and over for every new object created. However I still don't fully know how it works...
