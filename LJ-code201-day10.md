#LJ Code201 - Day 10

I thought the lab that had us try to reproduce the style of a webpage was a helpful exercise. It forced us to find solutions to layout problems. I think I will repeat this own my own for additional practice. It also emphasized that starting with a layout/design on paper is a good practice. I think this strategy would keep me from designing to what I already know how to do in CSS.

A review of week 2:

- tables and constructors
