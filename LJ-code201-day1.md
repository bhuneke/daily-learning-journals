# LJ Code 201 - Day 1

Things learned:
• A greater understanding of GitHub - like how to make a repository and push changes
• Create new repository, then in the Terminal:
    • git clone [paste copy of repository link from GitHub]
    • git status (to ensure it was cloned properly as a working directory)    
• git add [file] (git status)
• git commit -m "message" (git status)
• git push (git status)
• git push origin master

I feel like a need a little more independent study to fully understand the functions of Git/GitHub. I also need more practice creating repositories and committing changes.
